# Getting started ‚ú®
</br>

Welcome to my personal wiki, where I store all my findings, manuals and so forth! When I learn something new, I'll do my best to write it down here.
Browse on the left side to check up on my projects or use the search bar to find something specific :3

Consider visiting my [personal website](https://shiruvaaa.net/), [Github](https://github.com/silverfs) or my [Story hub](https://stories.shiruvaaa.net/)! üòä

My Wiki.js data-dump is available [here](https://github.com/silverfs/wikijs-datadump).
