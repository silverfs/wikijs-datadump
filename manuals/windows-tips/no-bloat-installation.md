# Windows 11 Installation Without Bloatware:

This does not need to be long. Let's dive right into it:

Begin by selecting English (World) as your region during the setup process.
In the 'Time and Currency Format' dropdown, choose European English or English (World).
This choice might trigger an error message labeled "OOBEREGION" due to language codes.
Don't worry if you see the red error message. Just click 'Skip' to continue the installation.
The benefit? A clean Windows 11 installation without unnecessary apps â€“ only the essential ones remain.
