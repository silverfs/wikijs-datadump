# Introduction
have you ever thought about how your Windows experience is missing a few things? Like it isn't quite finished? If so, then you're feelings are probably right. Windows sucks. Luckily, we can slightly improve our experience with this awesome tool :D.

<br />

## Features

Microsoft has been really quiet since Sergey Tkachenko (the creator of Winaero Tweaker) added tweaks for Windows 11. With it he brought some must-have features that everyone missed in Windows 11, like the classic context menus, the ribbon in the File Explorer and taskbar tweaks.

In addition to that, Winaero Tweaker provides tweaks that'll work from Windows 7 to 11. These tweaks range from context menu options, appearance and behavior settings, to extra tools, privacy tweaks and classic apps!
