Global

-   **Global Navigation** - A persistent navigation menu, displayed on all pages. Usually consists of important pages or links to external websites.
-   **Global Search** - Quickly find a page by performing a search.
-   **Create New Page** - Create a new page.
-   **User Menu** - User-specific actions such as View Profile, Administration and Logout.

# Basics

## Create New Page

In order to create a new page, click the **New Page** button, located in the top right corner of the page.

The following dialog will appear:

1.  Enter the full path to the page you want to create.
    -   The path should contain no spaces *(use dashes instead)*, no periods and consists of URL-safe characters.
    -   **DO NOT** put a trailing slash.
    -   You don't need to create folders. Enter the full path you want to create and folders will be created automatically. For example, enter `universe/planets/earth` to automatically create the universe and planets subfolders. This means that the last name at the end of the written path will coexist with the file you create, regardless of it's name.
2.  Click **Select** to proceed.

## Select an Editor

When creating a new page, you'll be prompted with the following dialog:

Wiki.js offers various editors depending on the type of content you want to write or simply user preference. Developers will usually go with the Markdown editor while non-technical users may prefer the Visual Editor, which is in this case the best thing to do.

For a complete list of editors and how to use them, refer to the [Editors](https://docs.requarks.io/editors) section.

## Enter Page Metadata

Upon selecting an editor, you'll be prompted with the Page Metadata dialog:

Enter a **title**, **description** and **tags** for your page.

Finally, click **OK** to close the dialog and start writing!

> You can always return to the Page Metadata dialog later by clicking the **Page** button, located in the upper-right corner of the page.

## Save

Your page is not created until you hit the **Create** button (located in the upper-right corner of the page). It will be saved and rendered, after which you'll automatically be redirected to the final result. Simply click the edit button to go back to editing!
