# What is it?
[Google Chronicle](https://chronicle.security/) is a Petabyte-scaled, cloud-native security analytics platform for threat investigation and hunting. Google Chronicle is built for managing an incredible amount of data in an efficient manner within an enterprise network. 
It provides many benefits over other solutions, like threat detection at Google speed and scale through Intelligence data fusion and indexing via Google. This provides a clear monitoring overview. 


# Data Collection
Chronicle accepts Ingestion APIs that enable logs to be sent directly to the chronicle platform, eliminating the ned for additional hardware or software customer environments. 

## Intelligent Data Fusion
Chronicle is able to map logs into a common model that enriches them automatically and categorizes them into timelines. This helps in displaying the entire span of an attack, which makes investigation efforts much more easy and effective.
