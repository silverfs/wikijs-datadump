# Introduction
In this file, I will be documenting my proof of my learning for the different themes regarding Cyber Security. 
The themes are in order as follows:

- [Web Application Security](#web-application-security)
- [Network Security](#network-security)
- [Security Concepts](#security-concepts)
- [Applied Security](#applied-security)
{.links-list}

<br />

> Learning tasks are defined and organised in Themes. By showing my learning process per theme, Learning Outcomes naturally follow.

## Version Control

Version history is actively tracked here: https://github.com/silverfs/wikijs-datadump/tree/main/manuals/cybersec/BoK


<br />
<br />

# Web Application Security
<br />

## Attack and Defence

- A guide and walkthrough of DVWA is available [here](/manuals/cybersec/BoK/website-attack-defence). 
It includes examples of every category documented within the application(s) and ticks the boxes of the beginning theories from path traversal to SQL injection.


<br />
<br />

# Network Security
<br />

## Protect the Network

- [Secure Network Connections](/manuals/cybersec/BoK/secure-network-connections) talks about the importance of web-security, certificates and an extension of law regulations regarding this subject.

- [vpn](/manuals/cybersec/BoK/vpn) connections help make secure connections over the internet. Read more here.

## Attack the Network and Defend

- One of the more common and more easily accessible network attack methods are [Network Sniffing and Spoofing](/manuals/cybersec/BoK/sniffing-and-spoofing). Read all about it here.

## Monitor and Detect
- [Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention](/manuals/cybersec/BoK/network-intrusion-detection-and-prevention) talks about monitoring networks or systems for malicious activity. The most common classifications are network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) and host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS). 

- [IT Security Monitoring](/manuals/cybersec/BoK/security-monitoring) introduces the concepts of Security Monitoring.

<br />


# Security Concepts
<br />

## Introductionary Info

I've written an IT Risk Analysis with some threat examples which you can find [here](/manuals/cybersec/BoK/analysis). They'll give some more understanding about the theoretical approach. Other examples apart from the ones used for the risk analysis will be provided.

To provide some basic understanding about the subjects, I will provide examples about cybercrime cases in order for me and the readers to familiarize ourselves with cyber crime cases.
All these cases, including my personal views are available [here](/manuals/cybersec/BoK/lerd). 

- [laws](/cybersec/BoK/laws) will talk about Law, Standards and Compliance.

## Identity Management, Authentication and Access Control

- [Footprinting, Reconnaissance and Social Engineering](/manuals/cybersec/BoK/frse) talks about the importance and usage of footprinting.
