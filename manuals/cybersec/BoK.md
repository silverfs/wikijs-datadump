# Introduction
In this file, I will be documenting my proof of my learning for the different themes regarding Cyber Security. 
The themes are in order as follows:

- [Web Application Security](#web-application-security)
- [Network Security](#network-security)
- [Security Concepts](#security-concepts)
- [Applied Security](#applied-security)

<br />

> Learning tasks are defined and organised in Themes. By showing my learning process per theme, Learning Outcomes naturally follow.

# Security Concepts


## Introductionary Info

I've written an IT Risk Analysis with some threat examples which you can find [here](/manuals/cybersec/BoK/analysis). They'll give some more understanding about the theoretical approach. Other examples apart from the ones used for the risk analysis will be provided
To provide some basic understanding about the subjects, I will provide examples about cybercrime cases in order for me and the readers to familiarize ourselves with cyber crime cases.
All these cases, including my personal views are available [here](/manuals/cybersec/BoK/lerd). 


## Identity Management, Authentication and Access Control
