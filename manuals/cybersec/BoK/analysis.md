# IT Risk Analysis

In this part, I will perform a qualitative threat and risk analysis on a non-existent company to document, shocase and improve my analysis skills.

<br />

An IT risk analysis helps identify and manage potential problems that could affect the IT infrastructure. As the concepts and the environments of IT are constantly changing and evolving, so are the risks and threats. Creating and doing a risk analysis will estimate the potential of a threat/risk to an IT environment.

There are different kinds of threats and thus risks an IT environment or a company can face these days. Knowing these threats and the motivation behind it is a step that can estimate the dangers and/or impact on e.g. a company. 

<br />

> Note: The threats are evaluated based on the likelyness that it will occur, and the impact that it will have on the situation as a whole.
