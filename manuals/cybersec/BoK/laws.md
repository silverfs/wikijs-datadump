# Introduction

Laws and standards will always be a key part of IT. There are many rules about what you can and cannot do with data, especially as a company. Among other things, hefty fines go hand in hand without compliance with the law.

# GDPR Regulation
<br />

Using information acquired through a workshop given at my school, I wanted to talk a bit about the European GDPR regulation or principles.

*"The General Data Protection Regulation is a European Union regulation on data protection and privacy in the EU and the European Economic Area."
~ Wikipedia*

The 7 GDPR principles are principles which you must abide by if you want to comply with the GDPR regulation. These consist of (taken from official GDPR sources):

1. Lawfulness, fairness and transparency — Processing must be lawful, fair, and transparent to the data subject.
`You only collect data from the user that the user is aware of. The user is often "aware" by giving consent through a simple statement or by agreeing to terms. You may therefore not collect more information than the user has agreed to.` <br><br>
1. Purpose limitation — You must process data for the legitimate purposes specified explicitly to the data subject when you collected it.
`You may not use the data you have collected for other purposes that are not indicated.` <br><br>
1. Data minimization — You should collect and process only as much data as absolutely necessary for the purposes specified.
`It is therefore not the allowed to collect data without a specified purpose. It must also be recorded what data is collected and what it is used for.` <br><br>
1. Accuracy — You must keep personal data accurate and up to date.
`If data is not accurate, it needs to be removed.` <br><br>
1. Storage limitation — You may only store personally identifying data for as long as necessary for the specified purpose.
`You'll only save data for a certain amount of time. Not for forever.` <br><br>
1. Integrity and confidentiality — Processing must be done in such a way as to ensure appropriate security, integrity, and confidentiality (e.g. by using encryption).
`One way to accomplish this is by anonymizing data. If data ever leaks it would not be traceable to a person.` <br><br>
1. Accountability — The data controller is responsible for being able to demonstrate GDPR compliance with all of these principles.
`This means that you document and account for every step you take with the data. In large companies, this documentation often needs to be automated.`

# Evaluation

By reading through a lot regarding GDPR, I know a lot more about how these principles can be upheld and why. Data processing is becoming more important day by day and we all need to make sure it'll be securely processed now and in the future.
