# What Is Footprinting?

Footprinting means collecting information about systems and the entities they belong to. Collecting this information might sound hard to do, but can be a a breeze in the right circumstances. You can use various Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) sources to gather and map public data like social- and mass media, archives and geo-location tools like OSM.

Social media information gathering is widely used and one of the most straightforward and common practices of footprinting. When you have a target in mind, You'll want to find out as much as possible before thinking about hacking, pentesting, etc. Start by gathering first-layer public information, like the target's (business)name and address, what contact methods they use (email, social-media, etc.) Owner of said-business and closely related co-workers, stocks, and much more. You can further dig into a particular person's social-media accounts and find more private information like a home-address, personal email and phone number and what other services they might use. linking several personal data collections can be beneficial to see when that said person leaves to and from work and find out when nobody is present or when it's busy within a company. you could find a floor-map of the building(s) and gather information about the workplaces and server rooms. 
You can go into much more detail and eventually escalate it to a structured attack, but that is a story for another article.

When you want to use your hacking skills on, for example, a company - be it for nefarious reasons or pentesting - You'll need to gather information to make the process go as smooth as possible.
You can go from as simple as social media scanning to Google Dorks, which I'm still not sure why these features are still allowed and continued. 
For reference, When you use Google Dorks, you use search strings that leverages advanced search operators to find information that isnâ€™t readily available on a particular website and/or in normal circumstances.

## Example

I'll display a short example of footprinting some people in a large company. Let's pick our target first:
