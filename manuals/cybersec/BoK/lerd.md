# Cyber Crime Cases

<br />
<br />
Down below are cases which include my personal view on some quotes from these cases.
<br />

## The BonziBuddy Case

<br />

> Bonzi Software, a top Internet advertiser, agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit accusing the company of deceptive advertising, according to the plaintiff's counsel.
The suit, filed in Washington state in November, accused Bonzi of engaging in a "diabolical scheme" that tricked Internet users into clicking through to Bonzi's site by displaying online ads that mimicked dialog boxes with "message alert," security alert," or "warning" in the creative.

The first few sentences are already quite interesting, as it talks about deceptive advertising, which is a normal thing these days, but was not really known back then. This might be a good example of social engineering, as it associates with psychological manipulation.

Bonzi Software actually had a second case, one for the violation against the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

> UMG Recordings, Inc. and Bonzi Software, Inc. each have agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that they violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by knowingly collecting personal information from children online without first obtaining parental consent...
   ...Bonzi Software, distributor of the BonziBUDDY software, will pay civil penalties of $75,000. The Bonzi Software case is the first COPPA case to challenge the information collection practices of an online service in connection with a software product.
   
This case is "*the first challenge to infomation collection practices*" which gives a clear view of the progress in battling anti-privacy behaviour. What struck me was the fact that at the time, no one really talked about the "easy infomation gathering" when downloading the BonziBuddy software. Even to this day, there are barely any mentions about it. Back then, before making use of the purple gorilla, you as a user had to fill in some important personal information, like your address, name, age, phone-number, etc.

# A Personal Take
<br />

> What would I do if I would unexpectedly find a high risk vulnerability in a website or IT-infrastructure. I have to take into consideration if I want to make money or to make the world a safer place.

If I would ever find a high risk vulnerability unexpectedly, my first move, if possible, would be to alert the website or infrastructure in question. It would be not so different if it was my job, but in that case, I would probably - but that depends on the company's behaviour towards the finding - I'd report it online through NVD/CVE to help people know to protect their own data and help the company resolve the problem.
