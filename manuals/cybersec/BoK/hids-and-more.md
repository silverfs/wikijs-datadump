# Introduction
<br />

- **NIDS**
Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a type of security software that monitors network traffic for signs of security breaches or malicious activity. It analyzes network traffic in real-time to identify patterns or anomalies that may indicate an attack or compromise. NIDS is typically deployed at strategic points within a network to monitor traffic for all devices on the network.
<br />

- **HIDS**
Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) is a type of security software that monitors and analyzes activity on a single host or device for signs of security breaches or malicious activity. It analyzes logs, system files, and other data sources on the host to identify patterns or anomalies that may indicate an attack or compromise. HIDS is typically installed on individual devices or servers to monitor activity on those specific devices.
<br />

- **IDS**
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a general term that refers to any system that is designed to detect security breaches or malicious activity within a computer system or network. IDS can be either network-based (NIDS) or host-based (HIDS), as described above.
<br />

- **IPS**
Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is a type of security software that is designed to actively block or prevent security breaches or malicious activity. It analyzes network traffic in real-time, like a NIDS, but also has the ability to take proactive measures to prevent attacks or compromise. This may include blocking traffic from a specific IP address, closing a network port, or quarantining a file. IPS is typically deployed in a network to actively protect all devices on the network.
