# Introduction

This paper is written with the purpose of clarifying the unconventional, unclear and rather difficult process of the German VAT registration. This paper will mainly focus on selling on marketplaces in Germany such as Amazon DE where you have to register for VAT.
I'm writing this from a Dutch perspecive. That means being a Dutch seller/company wanting to sell goods through Amazon DE to German consumers.

This paper is not written for those who are providing services local to German companies. For those situations, you can use the [German Reverse Charge Process](https://marosavat.com/manual/vat/germany/reverse-charge/).
<br />

Make sure to read, note and judge everything with a keen eye. a VAT registration in Germany can take anywhere between 8-12 weeks if an application has been submitted correctly. A wrongly submitted application could take longer and for non-eu businesses the Tax administration may ask for additional information before registering you for German VAT


<br />

>Value Added Tax in local language is "Mehrwertsteuer" and the acronym VAT is translated as "MWSt".

# When Do I Register For VAT?
<br />

Before we start, let's make sure you actually know when to register for VAT. You should register for German VAT at least under these broad situations:
<br />

- Importing goods into Germany from another country, either from within the EU or from outside the EU
- Intra-community supplies & acquisitions
- Buying and selling goods in Germany
- Selling goods over the internet to German consumers, subject to the EU 10K EUR distance sales threshold
- Goods held in consignment stock
- Holding live exhibitions, events or training in Germany
- If a company is otherwise a non-VAT trader, but is receiving services in Germany under the reverse charge rule
- The self supply of goods

<br />

If you are a provider of electronic, broadcast or telecom services to consumers in Germany, you can take advantage of the OSS Scheme (previously MOSS). This makes it possible to file a single return for all 27 EU countries without having to VAT register. This scheme is also available for goods which are stored within Germany to avoid VAT registration in the other EU countries, however, a German VAT number is still required due to the storage itself. More on this later.

<br />

For foreign businesses trading in Germany that are registered with VAT in their own country, the VAT registration threshold is Zero. This means you have to register for VAT in Germany if you wish to sell goods to German consumers before you even make your first sale in the country. There are 3 ypes of German VAT's:

| Rate | Type |
| :----: | :----: |
| 19% |  Standard |
| 7% | Reduced |
| 0% | Zero |
<br />

**19% Standard** – All other taxable goods and services.

**7% Reduced** – Some foodstuffs; water supplies (excluding bottled water); medical equipment for disabled persons; some domestic passenger transport; intra-community and international passenger transport for certain road, rail and inland waterway transportation; books (excluding e-books and books whose content is harmful to minors); audiobooks; newspapers and periodicals (except those containing content harmful to minors and/or more than 50% advertising); admission to cultural events; writers and composers; some agricultural inputs; hotel accommodation; certain admission to sports events; social services; medical and dental care; firewood; some timber for industrial use; take away food; cut flowers and plants for decorative use and food production; taxation of some gold coins and jewellery.

**0% Zero** – Intra-community and international transport (excluding road and rail and some inland waterways transport).

# Terms And Their Meaning

<br />
<br />

### VAT
Or **Value-Added Tax**, is in the European Union a general, broadly based _consumption tax_ assessed on the value added to goods and services. It applies more or less to all goods and services that are bought and sold for use or consumption in the European Union. Registering for VAT allows you to claim the VAT back and offset it against your purchases.
<br /> 

### Intra-Community supplies
The intra-Community supply and acquisition of goods occurs where _goods are dispatched or transported between businesses in different Member States (MS) of the European Union (EU)_. 
For Value-Added Tax (VAT) purposes, two transactions are deemed to have occurred:

- intra-Community acquisition (ICA)
- intra-Community supply (ICS).
