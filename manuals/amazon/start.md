# Find Profitable Products To Sell


Find a combination of **High demand** and the product being **profitable**. Take calculated risks, not just risks.

Choose where you want to sell (germany)

Try a product between 15 - 30. Too much is difficult, too little won't be profitable, etc.


If you want to successfully sell a product, it is best to follow a couple of rules/criteria:

- **Sell a product for at least €10 - €15 euros.**
  Customers can only buy a product under €10,- as an addon product, meaning you have to buy more to get free shipping. €15,- product or more has more potential to sell better to better to people in the future as you get more reviews and you build up a reputation.
 <br /> 
 
- **Go for a relatively small product.**
  It's not too big or heavy. Bigger products means more expensive to ship. Keep this in mind, because you want to have your fees low. You don't want to involve yourself in additional kinds of expenses and fees. Other great terms are _simple_ and _light._ As long as you get a good profit margin (around 25% or more) it may be worth wile.

- **Find a product that potentially solves a problem**
	Example from a guy on the internet:

  > Blue light filter glasses. These glasses solves a problem. It helps people sleep better. It blocks blue light from all kinds of things (phone, tv, etc), helps your brain release [melatonin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin). You cold get better quality sleep and it's in the _market_ of sleep.
  if this product is a success, what's gonna be my next product and my third product? This'll help in the long run by open up doors to building a brand that has many additional other products.
