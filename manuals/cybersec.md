# Introduction

## Contents of This Semester
My name is Faizal and welcome to the S4 Documentation hub, where I'll be documenting all my creations, findings and research regarding this semester of Cyber Security 2022-2023. 

I wanted to join Cyber Security classes because I saw the most potential in this broad theme, next to my personal interests in this subject. I did not actively do many things security-wise prior to this semester, but I already had experience with networking and Windows and Linux servers, so basic applied security within these themes are already known.
