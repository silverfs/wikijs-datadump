# Introduction


My name is Faizal and welcome to the S4 Documentation hub, where I'll be documenting all my creations, findings and research regarding this semester of Cyber Security 2022-2023. 
<br />
<br />


## What was my relevant prior knowledge and experience on security, Linux and networking,and what did I do to obtain this knowledge?
I consider myself a privacy advocate, and although not much, it naturally involves a bit of security. Other than that, most of the things I've learned this semester are fairly new for me. I've had prior knowledge and experience with Linux and networking through my previous study, so that helped me a lot in this semester.
<br />

## What was my preferred learning style and why?

My prefered learning style would still be demand-based learning. As long as everything is written down in a clear manner. The planning per week for workshops really helped to clear it up.
<br />

## What motivated me to join cyber security?
I wanted to join Cyber Security classes because I saw the most potential in this broad theme, next to my personal interests in this subject. I did not actively do many things security-wise prior to this semester, but I already had experience with networking and Windows and Linux servers, so basic applied security within these themes are already known. Due to that prior knowledge, it helped me set my interests and goals.
<br />
       
## What are me strengths and weaknesses?

I've noticed this semester that one of my weaknesses is my procrastrination. I've noticed that it's been going better through the semesters, but it is still not on a level that I'm happy with. There are things that could help me greatly by having it done earlier than I have now. I know I can do it, but it's just a matter of willpower.

One of my strengths I've noticed within this semester is the ability to focus when it comes down to it. Especially when writing research. I tend to really dig down in knowledge sources to get the most out of my research paper and I enjoy it. I just need to watch out to not let it get out of hand. 

In addition, I am good at my profession and I pair it with a lot of practical experience, which makes it a lot easier for me to judge what is realistic to do and what is not.

# Learning outcomes
<br />
<br />

## Ethical Hacker
You analyze the security of diverse IT environments, such as a business environment, a consumer product, or a technology, according to a common method of pen-testing.
<br />

### Overal impression
The overal impression of Ethical hacker was pretty good. I've had a lot of hands on experience and that helped me greatly. My favourite subject was working with DVWA, because there were a lot of different things to study. Inside that, the best subjects would be network sniffing and spoofing and password/wifi hacking. As these things are more likely to occur in the outside world, it seems more practical. It's just sad that you can't really do it like that in actuality. 

### What did I learn?
I've learned to analyze the security of diverse IT environments through multiple ways. Those ways would be through DVWA, but also through hands-on experience with pentesting a company, which greatly enhanced my view about ethical hacking. 

### What am I proud of?
I'm proud that I've learned a ton this semester of things I've never experienced before. At the start of the semester, everyting looked a little intimidating, but with enough practice, it became fun and easy. 

### How do I want to develop further?
I would like to continue develop my Kali skills, because there's a lot that I haven't done yet.

### What would I do differently next time?
I would continue my pace instead of slowing down after a while. Once I've slowed down, I noticed I've fallen behind quite fast and had to work some more to get it together again. 

### How would I grade myself?
In accordance to everything I've done with ethical hacking within this semester, I would give myself a an 7.5, as I have much more to learn, but I did learn many things through pushing myself to learn other things. 

<br />
<br />



## Risk Consultant
You analyse security threats and resulting business risks according to a common risk analysis method and advise a client on security improvements of an IT environment on a physical, technical and organizational level.
<br />



### Overal impression
The general impression I got from this subject was that it is very much on a non-technical level. In the end, I thought it added some value, but it's not something I would want to do later.

### What did I learn?
Here, I've learned about security risks in multiple ways. Where I've began my understanding from a simple analysis, I've further handled it through my PVI presentation, where I analyze, advice and improve on security aspects of an IT environment.  I would give myself a satisfactory in this category.

### What am I proud of?
I'm proud of, despite not really being into this subject, I managed to learn something and make use of it.

### How do I want to develop further?
I would like to continue broadening my horizon by getting involved in all kinds of similar scenarios.

### What would I do differently next time?
I would like to develop real business procedures. Doing that and applying it somewhere would help in a better understanding of the usecases. 

### How would I grade myself?
I would grade myself a 7, as I could have challenged myself a little more.

<br />
<br />

## Security Engineer
You realize a secure IT infrastructure environment, considering functional requirements as well as the following non-functional requirements: security, monitoring, ethics, compliance, usability.
<br />

### Overal impression
The nice thing about this subject is the ability to apply things as real scenarios. Virtualization plays a big role in this, and I have some experience with it, which is nice.

### What did I learn?
I've learned a lot when it comes to containerization. I've talked about it through both my PVI and my PSP. New and better ways to set things up, as well as aditional security. 

### What am I proud of?
I'm proud of not only performing all the individual tasks in the BOK, but even expanding my knowledge to my personal research papers. Configuring routers was pretty difficult for me in the beginning, but now I can even explain it to others.

### How do I want to develop further?
I would like to continue my development with Kubernetes, as I think it would be highly beneficial to learn it. 

### What would I do differently next time?
I would encourage myself to learn more on the security side techniques than I already did. But overal I'm pretty satisfied with what I already did.

### How would I grade myself?
I would give myself at least a 9. I've outdone myself in multiple projects with this subject, and I'm proud of that. 

<br />

## Security Analyst
You realize procedural response for security incidents and analyze these in an efficient and methodical way.
<br />

### Overal impression
This subject was not the best subject I did in the BOK. As I did these assignments later in the semester, they didn't stick as well as others. I had some hands-on experience with monitoring, but it wasn't much. Though, it was still interesting to learn it.

### What did I learn?
I learned what kinds of monitoring tools there are and what they are used for. 

### What am I proud of?
 I'm proud of gaining knowledge about different kinds of packets and methods for monitoring, as well as some good overal impressions.

### How do I want to develop further?
Having done some assignments of security analyst, I realized that there's more to see with security monitoring. Applying this on my pen test group project to try to see it from a different perspective has worked in my favor so far. I would like to continue working on monitoring, as I don't know much about the subject. Luckily, my upcomming internship would help me with this.

### What would I do differently next time?
I would spend more time researching the different methods, as they are more interesting than they seem.

### How would I grade myself?
I will give myself a 7.5. I've done my best, but I could've given it more time, if I allowed myself to. 


<br />

## Security Professional
You demonstrate your professional development as a cyber security specialist in the form of authentic IT professional tasks in which both the process and the results are visible.
<br />

### What did I learn?
I learned to create a better plan when it comes to having multiple projects within a group. I've also learned some good interaction knowledge and presentation skills.

### What am I proud of?
I'm proud that I could use the skills I've learned in all projects. I've learned to work closer together with people and come up with good ideas. 

### How do I want to develop further?
I would like to continue develop myself in working together with people. I have a feeling that it is a good thing to develop, and I need a lot more experience. I will have to be more objective in a project, which will be a challenge. 

### What would I do differently next time?
I would make decisions earlier when things might go wrong or something unexpected happens. Although I was assigned as a group leader, at times I was too relaxed to notice certain things.


### How would I grade myself?
I would give myself a 7.8. I did a good job managing my own and the group projects, but there are always things to improve.
