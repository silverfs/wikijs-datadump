# Introduction


My name is Faizal and welcome to the S4 Documentation hub, where I'll be documenting all my creations, findings and research regarding this semester of Cyber Security 2022-2023. 

I wanted to join Cyber Security classes because I saw the most potential in this broad theme, next to my personal interests in this subject. I did not actively do many things security-wise prior to this semester, but I already had experience with networking and Windows and Linux servers, so basic applied security within these themes are already known.

# Learning outcomes
<br />
<br />

## Ethical Hacker
You analyze the security of diverse IT environments, such as a business environment, a consumer product, or a technology, according to a common method of pen-testing.

My favourite subject was working with DVWA, because there were a lot of different things to study. I've learned to analyze the security of diverse IT environments through multiple ways.  I would like to continue develop my Kali skills, because there's a lot that I haven't done yet. In accordance to everything I've done with ethical hacking within this semester, I would give myself a satisfactory satisfactory. 
<br />

## Risk Consultant
You analyse security threats and resulting business risks according to a common risk analysis method and advise a client on security improvements of an IT environment on a physical, technical and organizational level.

Here, I've learned about security risks in multiple ways. Where I've began my understanding from a simple analysis, I've further handled it through my PVI presentation, where I analyze, advice and improve on security aspects of an IT environment. I would like to continue broadening my horizon by getting involved in all kinds of similar scenarios. I would give myself a satisfactory in this category.
<br />

## Security Engineer
You realize a secure IT infrastructure environment, considering functional requirements as well as the following non-functional requirements: security, monitoring, ethics, compliance, usability.

I consider my well-versed in the infrastructure learning curve. Having an IT Infrastructure background, these topics have been a smooth learning curve for me, and I've enjoyed creating them. I still learned a lot, as I've seen and experienced multiple scenarios within infrastructure security. This would be pretty advanced.
<br />

## Security Analyst
You realize procedural response for security incidents and analyze these in an efficient and methodical way.

Having done some assignments of security analyst, I realized that there's more to see with security monitoring. Applying this on my pen test group project to try to see it from a different perspective has worked in my favor so far. What I like about monitoring are the different kinds of ways I can do it. I'll give it a satisfactory, as I have much to learn, especially on my internship. 
<br />

## Security Professional
You demonstrate your professional development as a cyber security specialist in the form of authentic IT professional tasks in which both the process and the results are visible.
